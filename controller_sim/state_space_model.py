STATE-SPACE MODEL + STATE FEEDBACK CONTROLLER DESIGN
============================================================
This extends the original 2-state "dummy example of a control
system" to an N_MASSES-mass chain, giving a 2*N_MASSES state
system while keeping the exact same generic model used before:

    Error:            e(k) = r(k) - y(k)
    Controller:        u(k) = K e(k)              (state feedback: u = -Kx)
    State update:     x(k+1) = A x(k) + B u(k)
    Output:            y(k) = C x(k) + D u(k)

Plant chosen: a chain of N_MASSES masses connected in series by
springs and dampers (mass 1 is anchored to a fixed wall, mass
N_MASSES is free). A single actuator force u is applied to the
LAST mass in the chain, and the LAST mass's position is measured.
This keeps the controller SISO (one input, one output, one gain
row) -- identical in spirit to the original mass-spring-damper --
it's just N_MASSES of them daisy-chained together instead of one.

    wall --[k,c]-- m1 --[k,c]-- m2 --[k,c]-- ... --[k,c]-- mN <-- u(t)

Each mass contributes 2 states (position, velocity), interleaved
exactly like the original 2-state model:

    x = [pos_1, vel_1, pos_2, vel_2, ..., pos_N, vel_N]^T

so state indices 0,1 are "mass 1" (equivalent to the whole state
vector in the original 2-state demo), and so on down the chain.

Set N_MASSES = 8 for a 16-state system, 9 for 18-state, etc.

    Why LQR instead of manual pole placement here:
    a long single-actuator mass chain has very unevenly
    "controllable" modes -- some modes need enormous gain to move
    at all, so hand-picking N desired poles (as in the 2-state
    version) either fails or produces huge, numerically ugly gains
    that erode fixed-point HE accuracy. LQR instead asks for a good balance
    between control effort and state error, and produces a gain
    matrix that stays well-scaled even as the number of states
    grows. It reduces to the same idea as pole placement -- it
    still returns a single K such that u = -Kx -- just computed by
    solving the Riccati equation instead of specifying poles by hand.
